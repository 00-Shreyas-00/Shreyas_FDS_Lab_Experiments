<h1>FDS Lab Practicals</h1>
<p>Welcome to the chaos that is my second year's engineering lab practicals. Proceed at your own risk.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>So you want to see my code, huh? Well, here it is. This repository contains all the lab practicals I somehow managed to do last year. It's not perfect, but it works (mostly). Dive in if you dare.</p>

<h2 id="setup-instructions">Setup Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Clone the repo:
            <pre><code>git clone git@github.com:00-Shreyas-00/Shreyas_FDS_Lab_Experiments.git</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Navigate to the project directory:
            <pre><code>cd SHREYAS_FDS_LAB_EXPERIMENTS</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Run the code (good luck):
            <pre><code>python3 exp1_-_set_operations</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Run the scripts as they are, modify them if you dare, or just stare at the code in confusion. Your choice.</p>

<h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>
<p>Feel free to fork this repository and make it better (or worse, if that's your thing). Submit pull requests and I might just approve them if I'm feeling generous.</p>

<h2 id="license">License</h2>
<p>Do whatever you want with this code. I honestly don't care. But, if you become a billionaire using it, remember who helped you out.</p>

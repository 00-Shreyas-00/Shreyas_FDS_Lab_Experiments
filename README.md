Introduction
So you want to see my code, huh? Well, here it is. This repository contains all the lab practicals I somehow managed to do last year. It's not perfect, but it works (mostly). Dive in if you dare.

Practical List
Practical 1: Basic Hello World (because everyone needs one of those).
Practical 2: Sorting Algorithms (because why not?).
Practical 3: Data Structures (arrays, linked lists, trees - the usual suspects).
Practical 4: Operating System Simulations (because sleep is overrated).
Practical 5: Network Protocols (hope you like packets).
Setup Instructions
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/rebellious-engineer-lab-practicals.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd rebellious-engineer-lab-practicals
Install dependencies (if there are any):

bash
Copy code
# for example, if using Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the code (good luck):

bash
Copy code
python practical1.py
Usage
Run the scripts as they are, modify them if you dare, or just stare at the code in confusion. Your choice.

Contributions
Feel free to fork this repository and make it better (or worse, if that's your thing). Submit pull requests and I might just approve them if I'm feeling generous.

License
Do whatever you want with this code. I honestly don't care. But, if you become a billionaire using it, remember who helped you out.
